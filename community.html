            <h3>GS Lab recognizes that Open Source communities are innovation centers where the worldâ€™s greatest minds come together to work towards a common goal. Open Source technologies and the communities behind them are where much of this innovation is being driven from today. We contribute to Open Source through thought leadership, code contributions and financial support to the non-profit foundations behind them.</h3>
